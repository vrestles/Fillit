# Fillit

Program will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them
in order to create the smallest square possible. Main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time,
despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.

That was a group project. So part of this code was written by my coding partner.
